        <h2>About SoNaba</h2>
        <p>SoNaba is a beauty and wellness space created by me during my KKCF High School Fellowship. 
        The name means “to glow” in spirit, mind, and body. This project is about helping young women 
        feel confident, embrace self-care, and take small steps towards healthier living.</p>

        <p>My goal is to share beauty tips, wellness advice, and products that are gentle yet effective — 
        while creating a safe, supportive community for women everywhere.</p>
